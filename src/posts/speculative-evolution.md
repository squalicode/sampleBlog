Speculative evolution (or speculative biology) is a genre of speculative fiction and an artistic movement focused on hypothetical scenarios in the evolution of life, often considered hard science fiction because of its strong connection to and basis in science.

Works incorporating speculative evolution may have entirely conceptual species that evolve on a planet other than Earth, or they may be an alternate history focused on an alternate evolution of terrestrial life.
