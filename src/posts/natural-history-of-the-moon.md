After the Moon formed it settled in orbit around Earth much closer than today, making it appear much larger in each's sky and causing more frequent and stronger eclipses and tidal effects. Since then, due to tidal acceleration, the Moon's orbit around Earth has become significantly larger as well as longer, tidally locking the so-called lunar near side, always facing Earth with this same side.
